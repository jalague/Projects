## Chugg (the communal drinking game)

### This contains the classes for the drinking game "Chugg TM"

What is the Chugg?

This is a drinking game to be played with a large group of people. The game will randomly select someone from the group to drink or "Chugg" a random beverage at various intervals of time and send out a text message to the group saying who has to drink and what they have to drink (plus some fun quotes).


How to Play:

(Make sure you have the most recent version of Java downloaded and download the .exe game or run the RunGame.java file - you will need to request special permission from jalague first before messages can be sent out).

Open the .exe file to reach the GUI

Use the check boxes to enter which beverages you have available.

You will need to collect everyone's phone number and their Cell phone Carrier name. After you enter all the types of alcohol you have available and the mixers you have. Then enter the phone numbers along with the names of the players (up to 16). 

Then select how often you want the game to choose someone to drink and if it should be done randomly or at set intervals. Then start the game and leave the GUI open for the entirety of the game.
